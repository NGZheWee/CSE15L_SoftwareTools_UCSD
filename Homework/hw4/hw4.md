## Getting Started

Login to your 15L account either from a lab machine or via `ssh`. From your
home directory, enter the following commands:

```
$ gethw
$ cd ~/homework/hw4
$ vim hw4.md
```

Answer these questions in the `hw4.md` file you now have open.

_Don't forget to change the file header!_

1. Suppose you are testing a function using the JUnit framework, and want to check whether 
some variable `foo` equals 5. What is the one line of code to test this? **(1 point)**

        assertEquals(foo, 5);

2. From Lab 4, explain the purpose of our `CLASSES` variable for 
our Makefile. **(1 point)**

        we can use $(CLASSES) in the Makefile whenever we want to refer to those 3 files

3. From Lab 4, what happens if we type the command `make test` after 
no changes were made to the dependencies? **(1 point)**

        unit test will also run again.

4. You are a renowned software developer and you have been hired by an old
British boyband that wants to make a comeback in the industry. They ask you to
make an app to showcase their new music and events. In your implementation, you
have a class for each of the 5 group members, but you find that compiling each  
band memberâ€™s class takes more time than you currently have. Luckily, you  
remember that you learned about Makefiles in your favorite online class! You
decide to create a Makefile to compile your classes to make testing more
efficient. Since Makefiles can have multiple rules, write out the general
structure of a single rule and explain how it should be interpreted.
**(1 point)**

        compile: *.java
	        javac *.java

5. The lead singer, Harry Styles, wants to see his name printed every time his
rule is run. Write out the action that will print the phrase `Harry Styles` to the
terminal. **(1 point)**

        echo "Harry Styles"

6. Harry Styles insists that his rule is run by default whenever `make` is called.  
When you run `make` with no arguments, which rule is used by default?
**(1 points)**

        the first rule in Makefile

7. Your Makefile contains a rule named `rocks`. What line do you need to add to
your Makefile to ensure it is run every time `make rocks` is called, even if
`rocks` is a file that exists in the current directory? **(1 points)**

        .PHONY: rocks

8. To help keep up with the endless demands, you create the following structure.
Explain what the following lines do in a Makefile:  **(1 point)**

    ```Makefile
    .SUFFIXES: .java .class
    .java.class:
        javac $<
    ```

    We can compile a java source file A.java easily. Type 'make A.class'.

9. Makefile Practice: Tired with the old boys, you settle down to relive simpler
times, but make some errors in your Makefile. Can you fix them? See the Makefile 
in your `~/homework/hw4` directory for details **(6 points)**

## Turnin Procedure:
Be sure your `hw4.md` file is saved on your 15L  account in the directory
`~/homework/hw4`. When logged into your 15L account, enter the following
commands:
```
$ cd ~/homework/hw4
$ turnin15L
```
